/*
 * General note on "real time safeness" and performance optimization:
 *
 *	Since most of the code of a Audiality 2 unit will normally run within
 *	the realtime audio processing context of the engine, it is of utmost
 *	importance that the code is designed and optimized appropriately. In
 *	short, this means:
 *
 *		* No blocking or potentially time consuming system calls!
 *
 *		* Code should be optimized for deterministic execution times,
 *		  rather than best average throughput!
 *
 *		* Design and code for speed! Keep in mind that many of the
 *		  callbacks may be called thousads of times per second during
 *		  normal operation.
 *
 *		* Minimize memory and cache footprint! A sound engine running
 *		  in a low latency realtime setting typically wakes up about a
 *		  thousand times per second, and goes through all voices, VMs
 *		  and units at least once every time. Large data structures and
 *		  poor memory access patterns can have a massive performance
 *		  impact. The impact is even greater on a system under heavy
 *		  load, since other processes tend to push the sound engine out
 *		  of the cache whenever it goes to sleep after finishing a
 *		  buffer cycle.

/*
 * Control register write callback for A2_crdesc
 *
 *	Instructs the unit to change the value of a control register at the
 *	specified fractional sample frame, or, if 'duration' is non-zero, ramp
 *	the control register from its current value, starting at the specified
 *	time, running for the specified duration.
 *
 *	Ramping is expected to be linear, and the result of long ramps should
 *	not deviate significantly from the results of multiple short ramps
 *	describing the same function. (That is, be careful when ramping filter
 *	coefficients internally!)
 *
 *	The 'start' and 'duration' values are expressed in frames in 24:8 fixed
 *	point format. 'start' is in the range [0.0, 1.0] ([0, 255]) and is
 *	related to the start of the first sample frame to be processed by the
 *	next Process() call.
 *
 *	Ramping is normally performed with sample accurate timing (by means of
 *	"buffer splitting"), but asynchronous (typically long) ramps may not
 *	always terminate exactly on a buffer boundary! It is acceptable for
 *	units to handle this by stretching the last segment of the ramp to the
 *	full length of the processing fragment the ramp should end in. This is
 *	still fairly accurate, as processing fragment size is restricted to
 *	A2_MAXFRAGMENT sample frames for cache footprint reasons.
 *
 *	'duration' is just a target point for ramping, so it may land way
 *	beyond the end of the next fragment to be processed. Do not rely on it
 *	being directly related to processing fragment or buffer sizes!
 *
 * NOTE:
 *	This will run in the real time context of Audiality 2, and will be
 *	called whenever a VM program changes the contents of the respective
 *	control register. (Actually, the current VM implementation "filters"
 *	register writes so that only the final value is applied to the mapped
 *	control register as a timing instruction is executed.)

 *	A2_unit header portion will be filled in before the initializer is
 *	called.

 *	and this happens on they fly, in the realtime audio context. Keep it

 *
 *	If the OpenState() call fails (non-zero return), it will not be
 *	possible to instantiate the unit in the affected state.

 *	timing, processing is done in variable size fragments. The 'offset'
 *	argument specifies where in the connected I/O buffers processing is to
 *	begin, and 'frames' specifies how many sample frames to process from

 *
 *	Readable control registers may be implemented by having the unit write
 *	back values into the VM registers via the 'registers' pointer in the
 *	A2_unit header of the unit instance.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *	It is actually legal to specify control registers without callbacks!
 *	What happens is that a VM register is allocated, but the register works
